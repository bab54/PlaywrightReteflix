# Feature: Subscribe on Home page

#     As a visitor on Reteflix  website
# I want to see the subscribe button separately not overlapping
# So that I can scroll freely without clicking on other buttons
# Scenario: Valid subscribe button

# Given that I am a user on the ReteFlix website "https://reteflix.reteicons.com/"
# # And  i scroll to the footer of the page
# # When I navigate to the subscribe Button
# Then I should see subscribe button and  the spacing between the subscribe button and other Icons
