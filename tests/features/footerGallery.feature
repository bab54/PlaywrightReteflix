Feature: Gallery page footer

As a user of Retefliex website
I want to see the same footer on gallery page of ReteFlix website
So that I can enjoy the consistency and flow of a streamlined website.

Scenario: Valid Gallery page Footer
Given i sign  into the  reteflix website "https://reteflix.reteicons.com/"
When  i click on gallery button on the home page
#Then i should see the message "Eagle\'s Eye Productions" in that position
#Then Eagle's Eye Productions - our films shape moments and inspire change shoud be visible
Then what i should observe the words - should be Eagle's Eye Productions - our films shape moments and inspire change
